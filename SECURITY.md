# Security Policy
Border0 takes the security of our software products and services seriously.
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Border0 owned repositories, please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to security@border0.com.  
You will receive a response from us within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible.

Even when unsure whether the bug in question is an exploitable vulnerability, it is recommended to send the report to security@border0.com first and not publically disclose this until we had a chance to produce a fix. 



*Examples for details to include:*

* Ideally a short description (or a script) to demonstrate an exploit.
* The affected platforms and scenarios (certain vulnerability might only affect specific OS', for example).
